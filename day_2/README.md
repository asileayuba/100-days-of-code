# 100 Days of Code: Day 2

## Learning Django Basics

Today, I dived into the basics of Django, focusing on setting up and understanding the framework's core components. Below is a summary of what I accomplished:

### Key Learnings
- **Setting up a Django Project**: 
  - Installed Django in a virtual environment.
  - Created a new Django project using the `django-admin startproject` command.

  - Understood its structure and the role of important settings like `INSTALLED_APPS`, `DATABASES`, and `TEMPLATES`.

- **Created a Basic App**:
  - Used the `python manage.py startapp` command to create an app.
  - Learned how to register the app in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

- **Running the Development Server**:
  - Started the server using `python manage.py runserver`.
  - Tested the default Django welcome page and customized URLs for new views.

- **Worked with Django Templates**:
  - Practiced rendering templates using the `render` function.
  - Created a simple HTML file and learned how to use Django's template engine.

# 100 Days of Code: Day 3

## Bootstrap Integration in Django Website

Today, I focused on integrating Bootstrap into my Django website. Below is a summary of what I accomplished:

### Key Learnings
- **Installed Bootstrap**:
  - Added Bootstrap to the project by linking the CDN in the HTML `<head>` section.
  
- **Integrated Bootstrap Styles**:
  - Applied Bootstrap's grid system and components to the existing HTML files.
  - Improved the layout of the homepage by using Bootstrap's container, row, and column classes.
  - Styled the navbar, form inputs, and buttons using Bootstrap classes.

- **Enhanced User Interface**:
  - Customized the carousel component using Bootstrap's carousel classes.
  - Incorporated a spinner that is displayed directly under the carousel images to indicate loading.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensured the website layout is responsive by using Bootstrap's responsive grid system and utility classes for better mobile support.

### Challenges and Insights
- Bootstrap's integration was straightforward using the CDN, but customizing certain components like the carousel required understanding its structure and JavaScript behavior.
- I learned how to make the page layout responsive and visually appealing with minimal effort using Bootstrap's built-in classes.
