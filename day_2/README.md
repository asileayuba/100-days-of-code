# 100 Days of Code: Day 2

## Learning Django Basics

Today, I dived into the basics of Django, focusing on setting up and understanding the framework's core components. Below is a summary of what I accomplished:

### Key Learnings
- **Setting up a Django Project**: 
  - Installed Django in a virtual environment.
  - Created a new Django project using the `django-admin startproject` command.
  
- **Explored the `settings.py` File**:
  - Understood its structure and the role of important settings like `INSTALLED_APPS`, `DATABASES`, and `TEMPLATES`.

- **Created a Basic App**:
  - Used the `python manage.py startapp` command to create an app.
  - Learned how to register the app in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

- **Running the Development Server**:
  - Started the server using `python manage.py runserver`.
  - Tested the default Django welcome page and customized URLs for new views.

- **Worked with Django Templates**:
  - Practiced rendering templates using the `render` function.
  - Created a simple HTML file and learned how to use Django's template engine.
