# 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to my **100 Days of Code Challenge** repository! This journey is all about consistency, learning, and growth as I dedicate at least one hour every day to coding for 100 consecutive days. My focus areas include Python, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Backend Development using Django, and integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into backend systems.

## Why I'm Taking This Challenge
As a backend developer and GenAI enthusiast, I am committed to expanding my skills in AI, Machine Learning, and Web Development. This challenge will allow me to:
- Sharpen my problem-solving abilities.
- Build real-world projects.
- Deepen my knowledge of Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Django.
- Explore the integration of Generative AI into backend systems.
- Document and share my progress with a wider community.

## Goals
Here‚Äôs what I aim to achieve over the course of these 100 days:
- **Python Mastery**: Enhance my skills in Python programming, focusing on data analysis and backend development.
- **AI/ML Expertise**: Learn and implement machine learning concepts using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Django Backend Development**: Build scalable backend applications with Django.
- **GenAI Integration**: Learn how to integrate Generative AI models into backend systems to create intelligent applications.
- **Portfolio Projects**: Create projects to showcase on my portfolio.
- **Consistency**: Build a daily habit of coding and learning.

## Rules
1. I will code for a minimum of 1 hour every day for 100 days.
2. I will document my progress daily in this repository.
3. I will update the log below with what I accomplished each day.
4. I will share updates on social media to stay accountable and inspire others.
